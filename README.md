# logichain
A decentralized, coordinate-based blockchain for real-world logistics and delivery tracking. Built with Python, FastAPI, and Leaflet.js. It verifies Proof of Delivery (POD) via secure checkpoints, maintains reputation by region, and distributes rewards fairly using geolocated smart contracts.


LogiChain: Decentralized Logistics Blockchain System

LogiChain is a decentralized logistics and delivery tracking system designed to eliminate centralized intermediaries and ensure transparency, accountability, and automation through blockchain technology. It provides a peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure for managing delivery contracts, validating proof of delivery, and distributing rewards based on geolocated checkpoints. The system is implemented in Python, uses FastAPI for its backend services, and features an interactive frontend powered by Leaflet.js.

System Overview

The system is structured around modular Python components, each fulfilling a specific function. Below is a summary of each module:

Core Layer

blockchain.py: Coordinates block creation, chain validation, and transaction flow.

coordinate_grid.py: Manages a global index of 65,341 geographic coordinates for delivery operations.

contract.py: Handles smart contracts tied to delivery logistics.

block.py: Defines the data structure of each block and includes validation routines.

Consensus Layer

bft_consensus.py: Implements Byzantine Fault Tolerance to ensure trust in validator selection.

hybrid_consensus.py: Merges Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Delivery (PoD) into a hybrid consensus algorithm.

Security Layer

security_manager.py: Validates transactions, prevents replay attacks, monitors anomalies, and limits coordinate saturation.

pod_contract.py: Manages Proof of Delivery contracts with privacy-preserving features.

Network Layer

p2p_network.py: Manages node discovery, synchronization, and block propagation across the decentralized network.

node.py: Provides the operational logic of each node in the network.

Tokenomics

tokenomics.py: Manages token issuance, distribution schedules, and mining rewards.

wallet.py: Manages user identities, wallets, and signing keys.

API Layer

rest_api.py: Exposes a RESTful API for contract interaction, delivery status queries, and public chain data.

Simulator

delivery_simulator.py: Emulates real-world delivery conditions and simulates contract fulfillment cycles.

Storage

persistence.py: Implements snapshot saving, historical recovery, and blockchain state management.

Functional Workflow

The delivery flow in LogiChain is automated, transparent, and securely validated through the following steps:

Contract Initialization

A logistics provider defines the delivery origin and destination using geographic coordinates.

The contract is cryptographically validated and recorded on the blockchain.

Delivery Execution

A driver accepts the delivery contract.

Checkpoints are logged as the delivery progresses.

Upon reaching the final destination, the system validates the Proof of Delivery based on encrypted and timestamped GPS data.

Reward Distribution

Upon successful validation, the reward is distributed between the driver and associated stakeholders (e.g., validators, pools).

Consensus Architecture

LogiChain uses a hybrid consensus model with the following components:

Proof of Work to initialize and secure blocks.

Proof of Delivery to validate real-world delivery events through geolocation.

Byzantine Fault Tolerance to allow honest nodes to reach consensus even in the presence of malicious actors.

Reputation Systems to enforce Sybil resistance.

View Change Protocols to support recovery from validator failure.

Security Measures

LogiChain integrates security measures across all layers of the architecture:

Digital signatures for transaction authentication.

Nonce-based replay protection.

Anomaly detection systems to prevent fraud.

Coordinate saturation management to prevent DoS attacks.

Optional payload encryption and ZK-proof integrations for privacy.

Token Economy

The maximum supply is fixed at 100 million tokens.

Genesis distribution includes 1,000 wallets with 1,000 tokens each.

Mining rewards follow a halving schedule every four years.

Reward distribution splits earnings between delivery drivers and validator pools.

Network Design

Peer-to-peer communication allows independent nodes to broadcast blocks and transactions without a central authority.

Synchronization algorithms ensure blockchain consistency across the network.

REST API endpoints and optional WebSocket services provide real-time system interaction.

Scalability and Future Extensions

LogiChain is designed to support:

Sharding for performance optimization.

Layer 2 scaling with payment channels or rollups.

Cross-chain bridges for interoperability with external blockchains.

An integrated analytics dashboard and route optimization engine.

Conclusion

LogiChain is an end-to-end decentralized logistics protocol built to serve the future of transparent, fair, and cryptographically secure delivery services. It provides strong guarantees of proof, privacy, and integrity while aligning economic incentives with real-world value. Its modular architecture and P2P foundation make it an ideal protocol for communities, enterprises, and decentralized platforms seeking trustless coordination and autonomous execution of deliveries.
